Hello, i gonna make this simple for you my friends. First at all, you have to create a pythton virtual environment and run:

 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 (while you have your virtual environment running, if not, youÂ´re going to install all the dependencies in your computer globally)

Then change the sql server instance name, database name, user, password and write your own database tables name in the methods below

send me an email if you can't run it by yourself.
